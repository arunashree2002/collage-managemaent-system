  <h2>  holidays is that most of them aren’t actually even days off, and many people are still required (or encouraged) to work them. We’ve evacuated the holiday of the rest and respite that it’s supposed to provide, and the reaction to that loss isn’t to create less accompanying work, but more of it. It’s a counter-intuitive reaction, but most coping mechanisms are — particularly when encouraged by contemporary capitalism, which both creates, widens, and exploits our feelings of lack. No one thinks they’re not creating a sufficiently magical holiday experience until someone else’s elaborate “harvest” deck display whispers that they are.

I’m not against holidays, or costumes, or Candy Corn, or traditions, or anything that you do in your family that actually feels meaningful, like you’re choosing your damn holiday choice, every year. But the sprawling, expensive, and exhausting holiday impulse — it is so rarely the celebration we crave. No one person, no one parent, no one spectacle can prop up the failing American ideal, or make us feel like we’ve got our shit on lock when so many forces outside of our control are ensuring that it our shit is very, very much not on lock: the rent’s too high, the childcare’s too tenuous, the future feels fucked. We could grapple with that, and decide on a different way forward

    If you’ve never been part of a Discord: I promise it’s much easier and less intimidating than you imagine.

    <h2>The holiday gradually filled with elaborate, labor-intensive practices, almost exclusively performed by women (Christmas card writing, gift procurement and wrapping, Christmas tree trimming, Christmas cookie making and exchanging, Christmas breakfast and dinner planning and cooking and cleaning) that have now been normalized as the scaffolding of a “perfect” Christmas experience. If you were poor, you did what you could (or, in the spirit of Dickens, hoped for the beneficence of the rich, or public spectacle endowed by the rich). If you were rich, most of the labor would still have been performed by servants.

        But after World War II, the labor expectations for Christmas Creation spread throughout the newly expanding middle class the same way washing machines did — and became yet another way for that generation of women to evidence their skill at “home making.” And as middle-class women began to move into the workplace in the decades to come, the expectation for Christmas creation — like so many other components of home making — remained constant, even as hours away from that home rose significantly.</h2>
